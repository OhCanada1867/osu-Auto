# osu!Auto

[QUICK DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT A HACK OR FOR REPLAYS]

This is just a random project I've been working on for fun to teach myself how to code so please don't expect much. 
> Like literally don't I can make things work but it's held together with duct tape and prayers so most of it is buggy.

The goal of this project is just to help automate or add things I felt should be in the osu! client by default such as not having to move song files every time I download a map since I'm too cheap for supporter or adding a way to view a map pool for multiplayer or tournaments.

Anyone is welcome to copy or build off of this code not that they would want to since it's a complete mess anyway

This project is not affiliated or supported by ppy or other developers of osu! in any way.
